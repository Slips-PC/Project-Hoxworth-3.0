# Project-Hoxworth-3.0
A discord.js-based bot dedicated to porting over the entirety of Overkill Software's "FBI Files" Payday 2 Information Repository. Also includes guides for perk decks. Protected under Mozilla Public License V2.0.

# What you need:
* A Windows, MacOS, or Linux-based machine.
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* The [nodemon package](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for Node.JS (if you already have this installed or know how to run a JS package in node, you can skip this one.)

# How To Use:
**WARNING: THIS PRESUMES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE CREATED THE BOT, COPIED IT'S TOKEN, AND ADDED IT TO A SERVER OF YOUR CHOICE. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT, GOOGLE IT.**
---
1. Download the Project Hoxworth folder. Put it somewhere easily accessible in the command line.
2. Open up the `config.json` folder and enter your bot's token into the 'Token' box. Make sure that it  is inside of the quotes. Optionally, you can change the bot's status, status type, and prefix here aswell, in the same manner.
2. Open up the node.js **command prompt** (not the regular node.js program) and navigate to the Project Hoxworth folder.
3. Type `npm run start` once you have entered the folder. The bot should activate. To test it, type `$h ping`, or whatever you changed the prefix to earlier in setup if you changed the prefix.

# How to find commands:
The commands are all listed in a pastebin, which can be found by typing `$h help`, or [here](https://pastebin.com/Q0gaydHt).

# How to get put in credits:
If you wish to be put into the "credits" command, make at least one pull request that either adds a new feature or another command in the case of the FBI Files commands.
