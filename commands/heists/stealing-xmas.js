As officers were trying to question him, the Payday Gang suddenly appeared at the mall, freeing the prisoner, shooting the mall to pieces, killing police officers and stealing various seemingly random items from the shops. They finished off by blowing the roof open with explosives and airlifting themselves and the prisoner out along with the Mallâ€™s enormous Christmas tree.\n\n"
